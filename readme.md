# Paraskevidekatriaphobia

![logo](logo.png)

I made this cute little game for [js13k](https://js13kgames.com/2024/).
The game is about helping little engineer to build a factory.

[Go, play it!](https://js13kgames.com/games/paraskevidekatriaphobia).

**P.S. to catch chicken just lie low and try not to scare it away.**


## Controls

* <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> to move.
* <kbd>Shift</kbd>  to move faster.
* <kbd>Space</kbd> to pick up things.


## Used technologies

* JavaScript for coding.
* Blender for modeling.
* WebGL1 for rendering.
* Python for Blender scripting and JS preprocessing.
* Terser for JS minification.
* Self-made improvised file formats for meshes and fonts.

I came up with a bunch of different tricks to fit everything in minimum amount of bytes. I would like to tell you something about it, but I at the moment I am lazy, so *to be continued...*
